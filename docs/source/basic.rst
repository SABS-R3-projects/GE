Basic Usage
===========

When you open the Paint4Brains application, a window asking you to "Load brain MRI" will appear. Here you can select the NIfTI file you wish to open in a directory of your system.

Loading an MRI image at the start is required as Paint4Brains will not start without it.

Once a NIfTI file has been selected Paint4Brains will finally open.

On the center of the screen an axial slice of the uploaded volume is shown. With both the coronal and sagittal view shown on two side panels on the left.

As you move your mouse around the central image, a yellow cross indicates your position on both of the other view. The view shown in the central image can be changed by double clicking on either of the side images. The 3-D position of your mouse is displayed on the bottom right corner

To explore different slices of the central image, the slider below it can be used. Scrolling the mouse wheel can achieve the same behaviour.
